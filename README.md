- The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.

- A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

- From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

 1. **pwd** outputs the name of the current working directory.
 
2. **ls** lists all files and directories in the working directory.

3. **cd** switches you into the directory you specify.

4. **mkdir** creates a new directory in the working directory.

5. **touch** creates a new file inside the working directory.
